<Introduction>

This is a disk image browser/editor for the Acorn BBC ssd and dsd image files.

<Operations>

Open an image file from the menu or the toolstrip button.
On the left the image file name is displayed, on the right all files in this image (both sides of the disk if present) will be displayed. 

You can drag/drop files from one side to another.

If you wish to move/copy files from one image to another, you can open a new window from the toolstrip button and load (or create) an image.
Then drag/drop from one window to the other.

If you copy a file to an image that is compacted (less then 800 sectors) the image will be automatically be resized to 800 sectors.
Before saving you could choose to compact it again. 

You can compact an image so it will look at the last sector used (on both sides if applicable) and resize the data to the least size needed.
After saving, the file will be generally smaller than a full sized image (2 * 800 * 256 = 400Kb in case of a double sided image).

You can also organize an image so all files will be alphabetically ordered and the used sectors will be consecutive.

The volume name and boot option can be adjusted by pressing the 'Volume' toolstripbutton.

The folder/file name and 'locked' attribute of the last selected file in the image can be adjusted by pressing  the 'File' toolstripbutton.
Also the right mouse button can be used if the mouse is hoovering over the file to be edited.

A file can be deleted from the image by pressing the 'Delete' button (last file selected will be deleted).

You can open files with the .ssd and .dsd extension with this application by double clicking the file if you set the apropriate file association.
